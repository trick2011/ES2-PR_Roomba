<br>&emsp;Roomba is a series of autonomous robotic vacuum cleaners sold by iRobot.Roomba was introduced in September 2002. As of Feb 2014, <br>&emsp;over 10 million units have been sold worldwide. Roomba features a set of basic sensors that enable it perform its tasks. For <br>&emsp;instance, the Roomba is able to change direction on encountering obstacles, to detect dirty spots on the floor, and to sense steep <br>&emsp;drops to keep it from falling down stairs. It uses two independently operating wheels that allow 360Â° turns in place. Additionally, <br>&emsp;it can adapt to perform other more creative tasks using an embedded computer in conjunction with the Roomba Open Interface.<br>

<br>&emsp;All Roomba models are disc-shaped, 34 cm (13") in diameter and less than 9 cm (3.5") high. A large contact-sensing mechanical 
<br>&emsp;bumper is mounted on the front half of the unit, with an omnidirectional infrared sensor at its top front center. A recessed <br>&emsp;carrying handle is fitted on the top of most units.<br>

<br>&emsp;As of 2015, there have been six generations of Roomba units: the first-generation Original Series, the second-generation 400 & <br>&emsp;Discovery Series, the third-generation Professional & 500 Series, the fourth-generation 600 Series, the fifth-generation 700 Series, <br>&emsp;and the sixth-generation 800 Series. All models have a pair of brushes, rotating in opposite directions, to pick up debris from the <br>&emsp;floor. In most models, the brushes are followed by a squeegee vacuum, which directs the airflow through a narrow slit to increase <br>&emsp;its velocity in order to collect fine dust. A horizontally mounted "side spinner" brush on the right side of the unit sweeps against <br>&emsp;walls to reach debris not accessible by the main brushes and vacuum. In the first generation of robots, the dirty air passes through <br>&emsp;the fan before reaching the filter, while later models use a fan-bypass vacuum.<br>

<br>&emsp;The Roomba is powered by a removable NiMH battery, which must be recharged regularly from a wall power adapter. Newer second- and <br>&emsp;third-generation models have a self-charging homebase that the unit searches for at the end of a cleaning session via infrared <br>&emsp;beacons. Charging on the homebase takes about three hours. Four infrared "cliff sensors" on the bottom of the Roomba prevent it from <br>&emsp;falling off ledges such as stairways. Most second- and third-generation models have internal acoustic-based dirt sensors that allow <br>&emsp;them to detect particularly dirty spots and focus on those areas accordingly. Fourth-generation models have an optical sensor <br>&emsp;located in front of the vacuum bin allowing detection of wider and smaller messes. Many second- and third-generation Roombas come <br>&emsp;packaged with infrared remote controls, allowing a human operator to "drive" the robot to areas to be specially cleaned.<br>

<br>&emsp;Some higher-end 500, 700 and 800 series robots are compatible with Virtual Wall Lighthouses, which use radio signals to communicate. <br>&emsp;These more advanced accessories confine a Roomba to a fixed area to be cleaned, yet allow the robot to later proceed to the next <br>&emsp;space to be cleaned.<br>

<br>&emsp;There are several types of dust and debris collection bins for the 500 series robots. The standard vacuum bin incorporates a <br>&emsp;squeegee vacuum. The high-capacity sweeper bin does not include a vacuum, but has greater debris capacity. The Aerovac Bin directs <br>&emsp;suction airflow through the main brushes instead of using a squeegee, which is thought to keep the brushes cleaner.<br><br><br>
